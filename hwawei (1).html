<h1>Early experience</h1>
<p>Kevin Durant was born in Washington, D.C., on September 29, 1988. As a child, he and his brother. Durant was raised by his mother Wanda Pratt and grandmother Barbara Davis. His biological father, Wayne Platt, left before Durant was a year old. Durant didn't see his father again until he was 13.
As a child, Durant did not show his outstanding talent in sports. But in Durant's childhood, he was always the tallest child in his class. So Durant's mother went to school and asked the teacher to let Durant stand at the end of the line when arranging to stand in line.
Durant and his brother have always loved sports. When Durant began to be fascinated by the wizard, who was the star of the wizard? It happened to be Michael Jordan. Watching more of the wizard's game, Durant and his brother gradually fell in love with basketball. After school, the two brothers always like to play in the boys and girls' club. They never play on the same team. They like to fight each other.
At the age of 11, Durant led the Jaguar team of George County, Prince, Maryland, to the national championship. Among them, Durant scored 18 points in the second half of the final. After that game, the excited Durant told his mother that he must play in the NBA. That's when Durant and Michael Beasley became good friends. Every day before breakfast, Beasley was sent to Durant's house by his mother. Then, two people go to school together and play ball together. They were also the absolute core of the Jaguar team at the time.
Looking at his son's basketball talent gradually revealed, Wanda found the basketball coach Talas brown. Brown made a strict training plan for Durant, the key is never to play wild ball on the street. Brown believed that the street side wild ball will only let Durant raise the bad habit. Durant listened to the coach. He never played wild. Instead, they spend eight hours a day in the training hall in the summer. In high school, Durant transferred to Oak Hill, a famous basketball high school. There, Durant averaged 19.6 points and 8.8 rebounds per game, and was named the second best team in the United States by Prada magazine. The following year, Durant moved to the National Christian College. Under the training of legendary high school coach Stuart Witte, the average score was 23.6 points and 10.9 rebounds, and he was selected into McDonald's national team, and also won the MVP of McDonald's all star game in 2006.
In high school, although Durant had made a name for himself. But his coach is too strict. Coupled with the fact that the stadium was too far away, Durant later recalled to himself, "I told my godfather that I didn't want to play basketball any more, and it took me a while to get up the courage to say that to him. But then I thought, this is the test of God, I may not be so degenerate
When the confused Durant wanted to give up basketball, "my mother knew what I was thinking. She pulled me aside and slapped me in the face. She talked to me a lot and gave me a lot of good advice. It's my mom who got me back on track. Since then, I've never been wrong again. " Durant said. After the end of high school, Durant has been favored by many famous basketball schools. And his level at that time, obviously ready to go to any one as a starter. Durant at that time, although his height has reached 2.05 meters, he still maintained the speed and instinct of the point guard. Durant, who has no rivals in high school, can do whatever he wants on the field of his peers. He has the ability to let his teammates score, and he can choose his own time and way to score easily.
When it comes to choosing a university, Durant's best friend, tawan Lawson, is bent on persuading him to go to the University of North Carolina. But in the end, Durant chose the University of Texas. Just on
Within a few months of college, Durant became one of the top ten scorers in the United States. At that time, Rick Barnes, the coach of the University of Texas, wanted to design close fitting tactics for Durant at the beginning. But soon Barnes realized that there was no need. Any tactics would only restrict the young man's talent.In the end, Durant averaged 25.8 points, 11.1 rebounds and 30 + points 20 times. Throughout the 2006-2007 season, Durant got 390 rebounds, which was the third highest rookie rebound record of NCAA at that time. At the end of the regular season, Durant was easily elected as the associated press college player of the year, as well as the Naismith and wooden awards.
Although personal data and honor are very exaggerated, but Barnes coach's tolerance, only to Texas in exchange for a 25-10 record, Durant did not fully grasp how to be a leader. This record ranks third in big 12 and top 20 in China. In the big 12 championship, Texas and the University of Kansas met. That game, Durant got 37 points. Unfortunately, Durant once had a chance to end the game with a layup, and the result was off.
After Durant joined the NBA, Durant's No. 35 Jersey was retired at the University of Texas and hung high above the stadium of the University of Texas.</p>
