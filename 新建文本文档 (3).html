<h1>physical talent</h1>
<p>Durant absolutely has excellent physical talent, he has 211cm height and 228cm arm spread. Durant's arm is getting thicker every season. No longer afraid of any physical confrontation, and often hit the shot or lay up when the body is out of balance, sometimes even dunk every 7 feet.
His skill of controlling the ball is very skillful. His quick cross, turn, stop and jump shot can only be seen in the defender. He has a soft hand and can score anywhere on the field. No one can block his jump shot. The organization ability and passing consciousness of point guard level can activate the attack of the whole team. Rebounds, especially offensive rebounds. Ball control is rare at this height.
Durant's most outstanding technique is his stable shooting ability. He is impeccable in shooting action and shooting percentage. His free throw is also one of his strengths.</p>
